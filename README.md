# ServerListMOTD - Set an MOTD as well as your playercount message!

**ServerListMOTD Latest Version:** - [![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.2.4-blue)](https://github.com/Bradydawg/ServerListMotd/releases/tag/1.2.4)

## ServerListMOTD:
ServerListMOTD was originally created by [(KennyTv)](https://github.com/KennyTV) for 
use on Spigot and Bungeecord Servers. The plugin allowed users to set a custom MOTD
and server-icon easily. KennyTv eventually moved on to greater things, so as of now,
I (Bradydawg) have taken over this project, in hopes to provide the spigot community 
with a fully supported version of the plugin.

## ServerListMOTD Dependencies:
ServerListMOTD was built with weight in mind, therefore, the dependencies are quite easy:
ProtocolLib, and PlaceholderAPI. Generally speaking, PlaceholderAPI is not a true 
dependency, but rather the plugin does provide support for it. ProtocolLib is only 
required if you are using the spigot version of the plugin.
